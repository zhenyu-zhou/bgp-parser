BGP Parser for CPS514/ECE558

These scripts aim to analyze real-world BGP traces and provide information for statistics.

aspath.py: Extract AS pathes from all BGP table entries. Please run the script with python2.

aspath_py3.py: The python3 version of aspath.py.

infer.py: Infer BGP link relationships with heuristic (Gaoâ€™s algorithm).

infer_py3.py: The python3 version of infer.py.

Usage:
python(3) <script> <input_file>

The result will be written to output files automatically. The output files should have sufficient information for you to get the required statistics.

Tested on OS X El Capitan and Linux 4.15.0.

Hints: Both input and output are large and it takes a while to run the code (~10-20min on my machine). Please be patient.
